## Background
This is not a disclaimer.

I'm writing this because I'd love to share the process and context of how I developed this app. It has been a learning experience for me more than anything....

The moment I got the email with this task, I was studying on my own little roadmap, getting back to React & NextJS after a 3-4 year hiatus. There wasn't much that I remembered anyway, I was gonna have to re-learn everything again, but I could already tell, a lot has changed since.... Functional components, hooks, the docs, NextJS, App router, Formik, the ecosystem...

What I want to emphasize is that I basically re-learned React & NextJS in this one week...(add everything else you learned, Formik, Prisma, Vercel deployments & storage, Mantine)

And whatever the result of the interview is, I probably won't stop learning anytime soon, I'm already `hook`ed (pun intended). But I'd love if I continue to do that with you.

And thank you for a well-thought out technical task, it was a valuable learning experience and shows you care about adabtapility and curiousity, which I appreciate. And as someone who's been through some questionable interviews lately, this task alone has been one of the most valuable and fun!
