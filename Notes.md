## Mantine
Check [this](https://mantine.dev/guides/next/#compound-components-in-server-components) Mantine link. That page has things on how to deal with compound components (`Component.XXX`), on routing, on polymorphic components (in case I ever need that), etc.
- There's still an issue where I can't find the `Col` component. I literally can't import it. But fuck it, I'll use TW grid & cols.

## NextJS
- Routes rely more on directory name, file names are standard, set in stone and won't change anytime soon.
- NextJS has a section of the docs talking about internationalization.
